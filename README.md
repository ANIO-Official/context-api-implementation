# Todo App ✅ | React Context API Implementation


_A React + TypeScript + Vite project focused on  building a functional Todo application that leverages React's Context API for managing the application's states instead of propdrilling._

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide practical experience in designing multiple contexts, implementing providers, consuming context values in components, and handling more involved state updates. 

Users should be able to:

- Change Theme
- Create new todos
- Read todos
- Update todos
- Delete Todos & all completed todos
- View active todos left.
- View saved todos & theme upon reopening web application.
